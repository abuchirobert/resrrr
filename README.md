Version Control:

What it is: A system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to older versions, compare changes, collaborate on projects efficiently, and maintain a clear history of development.
Why it's important:
Prevents accidental loss of work.
Enables collaboration among multiple developers.
Helps track bugs and identify the causes of issues.
Facilitates experimentation without fear of breaking things.





Git vs. GitHub:

Git: A distributed version control system (DVCS) that manages code locally on your computer.
GitHub: A web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, providing features for collaboration, code review, issue tracking, and project management.
Key difference: Git is the underlying version control system, while GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.
